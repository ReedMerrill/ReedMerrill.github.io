    "text": "Motivation and Problem\nMany important political processes occur at the state level, but it is not usually straightforward to measure public opinion at scales smaller than the national level.\n\nPublic opinion data measured at the level of individual states is few and far between.\nLarge public opinion surveys, such as the American National Election Study (ANES), are designed to be nationally representative, sometimes at the expense of state level representativeness.\n\nPriorities: national representativeness, in-person interviews (over web-based surveys)\nConsequences:\n\nSmaller sample sizes\nArea-clustered sampling\n\nNot representative of sub-national units"

I use Bayesian multilevel multinomial regression.\n\nUse predictors that are available in census data so that accurate estimates of the population proportions can be used during poststratification.\n\nMake predictions: Use the model from Step 1 to make predictions on characteristics from the broader populations of interest – in my case, states.\nPoststratify: Weight the predictions according to how frequently individuals with the combinations of your measured characteristics occur in the populations of interest."
