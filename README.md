# Estimating State-level Partisanship in the United States

This repo deploys a presentation about estimating party identification at the state level in the United States.

This presentation started out as an informal way of sharing a work-in-progress among PhD colleagues at a small symposium. That version is located at branch `saguaro`. Branch `main` is the most up to date version of the project and presentation.
