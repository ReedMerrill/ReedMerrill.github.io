## Motivation and Problem

Many important political processes occur at the state level, but it is not usually straightforward to measure public opinion at scales smaller than the national level.

- Public opinion data measured at the level of individual states is few and far between.
- Large public opinion surveys, such as the American National Election Study (ANES), are designed to be nationally representative, sometimes at the expense of state level representativeness.
    - Priorities: national representativeness, in-person interviews (over web-based surveys)
    - Consequences: 
        - Smaller sample sizes
        - Area-clustered sampling
            - Not representative of sub-national units

## Project Objectives

Estimate partisanship (percentage of population per party) in each state for the last 35 years.

- Need to specify a model that performs well on the American National Election Studies (ANES) survey data.

<!--
::: {.fragment}
ANES Data:

- available for every year of interest
- consistent measures across years (measurement validity)
- sacrifices representativeness
:::
-->

::: {.notes}
- Summarize this slide
    - The last 35 or so years could represent a "contemporary era" for politics
- Have made some progress. I will present my initial results and then show how feature selection, a data mining technique, has improved my model.
- Need to mine features: It is difficult to predict independent partisanship, and existing academic theories are limited in this regard.

## Multilevel Regression and Poststratification:

A technique used to improve the representativeness of unrepresentative survey data.

Steps:

1. Multilevel Regression: Train a model predicting the outcome on the survey data you want estimates for. I use Bayesian multilevel multinomial regression.
    1. Use predictors that are available in census data so that accurate estimates of the population proportions can be used during poststratification.
2. Make predictions: Use the model from **Step 1** to make predictions on characteristics from the broader populations of interest -- in my case, states.
3. Poststratify: Weight the predictions according to how frequently individuals with the combinations of your measured characteristics occur in the populations of interest.

## Predictors

**Individual Level**

These need to be available in census data so that geographic weighting using census data can later be used. They must also be categorical.

Predictors: 

- Age (7 categories)
- Race (white, black, hispanic, other)
- Sex (male, female)
- Education (5 categories; No high school to Post-graduate Degree)

## Predictors

**State-level**

The individual-level predictors can be supplemented to include state-level predictors, because it is straighforward to account for variation in state-level predictors in the upcoming weighting step [see @gelmanChapter].

Predictors: 

- Republican vote share from the most recent election
- Region (Northeast, Midwest, West, South, North Central)
- racial composition (pct. black residents)
- urbanity (pct. urban population)
- religious composition (pct. Christian)

::: {.notes}
- state level predictors improve predictive accuracy and facilitate sub-national estimation
:::

## Poststratification

- Constructed using the 5-year version of the Census Bureau's 2012 American Community Survey (ACS) via IPUMS USA.
    - Yearly demographic estimates of the population, based on 5 years of prior data

**Example Poststratification Frame**

|state   |region |rep. vote |eth      |male |age   |educ         |n      |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:--------|:----|:-----|:------------|:------|
|Alabama |South  |0.6055    |White    |0    |18-29 |No HS        |26344  |
|Alabama |South  |0.6055    |Black    |1    |50-59 |HS           |29100  |
|...     |...    |...       |...      |...  |...   |...          |...    |
|Wyoming |West   |0.6819    |Black    |1    |30-39 |Some College |120    |
|Wyoming |West   |0.6819    |Hispanic |0    |70+   |HS           |271    |

:::{.notes}
- This is part of poststratification frame, extracted from the 2012 frame that I constructed.
- Describe the table.
- Qickly explain the logic behind poststratification.
- Using models based on the previous multilevel regression equation, we can predict party identification at the individual level. 
- We then poststratify these predictions to estimate party identification at the state and national levels.
- Explain n per cell and overall proportions

## Model Training and Validation Approach

Model Training and Validation: Congressional Election Studies

n = 54,535

Simulate my use-case using this larger dataset. 

- Training set: 10% of the full sample per state
- Test set: The remaining 90%

::: {.notes}
- Missing levels for county and state are present in the ANES data I will ultimately derive my estimates from.
:::

## Predictive Modeling

Model: Bayesian multilevel multinomial logit model

- Predictors: State, Age, Ethnicity, Gender, Education, and state-level predictors
- Random intercepts for all predictors except "male"
- Interactions: gender & eth., educ. & age, educ. & eth.

$$
Pr(y_i = \text{dem, rep, ind}) = logit^{-1}[
\alpha_{\rm s[i]}^{\rm state}
+ \alpha_{\rm a[i]}^{\rm age}
+ \alpha_{\rm r[i]}^{\rm eth}
+ \alpha_{\rm e[i]}^{\rm educ}
+ \beta^{\rm male} \cdot {\rm male}_{\rm i} 
\\ + \alpha_{\rm m[i], r[i]}^{\rm male.eth}
+ \alpha_{\rm e[i], a[i]}^{\rm educ.age}
+ \alpha_{\rm e[i], r[i]}^{\rm educ.eth}
\text{(+ state-level predictors)}
]
$$

<p align="right">[see @gelmanChapter]</p>

::: {.notes}
- This model, due to its Bayesian approach, allows highly collinear variables and non-regularized models to be estimated. In a non-Bayesian linear or multilevel regression setting, this model would fail. 
- The multilevel models estimated during the Bayesian regression will estimate intercepts for every combination of levels of these variables and weight them according to the sample size and variance present at each level. This allows smaller, less well represented levels of the data to contribute to the overall model fit without exhaggerating their importance.

You then need to make predictions using the previous model for each row of the poststratification frame.

|state   |region |... |educ         |n      |$p(\text{dem.})$ |$p(\text{ind.})$ |$p(\text{rep.})$ |
|:-------|:------|:---|:------------|:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Alabama |South  |... |No HS        |26344  |0.032 |0.329 |0.639 |
|Alabama |South  |... |HS           |29100  |0.854 |0.094 |0.052 |
|...     |...    |... |...          |...    |...   |...   |...   |
|Wyoming |West   |... |Some College |120    |0.447 |0.102 |0.451 |
|Wyoming |West   |... |HS           |271    |0.338 |0.221 |0.441 |

$$
\theta_s^{MRP} = \frac{\sum_{j \in s} N_j \theta_j}{\sum_{j \in s} N_j}
$$

<br>

where $\theta$ is the predicted party identification, $s$ is the state, $N$ is the number of cells in the poststratification frame, and $j$ is each cell of the poststratification frame.

## Validation

The above procedure results in state-level estimates for each state are adjusted based on characteristics of each state and the proportion of different demographic combinations in them. 

To test the accuracy of this model, I treated simple partisanship means taken from the Congressional Election Studies test set as the "truth".

- Subtracted each state's predicted partisanship distribution from the distribution of partisanship derived from the test set.

::: {.notes}
- This procedure gives me a set of absolute errors in terms of how far each state's predicted partisanship was from their "actual" partisanship.
- I used this procedure to the reduction in absolute error associated with different specifications of the predictive model.
